%% Rice Analysis
%
% This example of Matlab attempts to show how can we do Image Analysis by
% segmenting and classifying objects in an image.
%
% This program counts the number of rice present in an image. In addition, 
% the average and standard deviation of the size are computed.
%
% WARNING: the presented solution is very simple. The goal of this code is
% to show how can we use Matlab in Image Analysis. Obviously, better
% results can be obtained using more complex algorithms.

%% 1. Image acquisition
% In this part, we read a digital gray-scale image, and we store it in a
% matrix using two formats: 
%
% a) 'uint8' for bytes (uint8: unsigned integer with 8 bits) and 
%
% b) 'double' for double precision.

close all                    % All figures are closed
clear all                    % All variables are deleted
U = imread('rice.png');      % Read image rice.png 
I = double(U);               % Conversion to double

%% 2. Image display
% In this part, we display the image using grayscale and 3D representations. 
% In addition, we label the axes.

imshow(I,[])                 % Display image I: min(I) is black max(I) is white

enterpause                   % Press <Enter> to continue...

%% 3. Histogram
% In this part, we compute the histogram of the image, i.e., how many 
% pixels we have in the image for each gray-value.

figure                       % Open new figure
imhist(U)                    % Histogram of uint8 image

xlabel('Gray-values');       % Name of x-axis
ylabel('Frequency');         % Name of y-axis
enterpause                   % Press <Enter> to continue...

%% 4. Segmentation using a global threshold
% In this part, we compute a binary image B by thresholding. 
% 
% In this case, B(i,j) = 1 if I(i,j)>th, else B(i,j) = 0. Ideally, B(i,j) = 
% 1 if the pixel (i,j) belongs to the rice region, and it is 0 if it belongs 
% to the background. 
%
% However, a global threshold does not segment well the image because 
% the certain gray-values of the background (top of the image) are similar 
% to certain gray-avlues of the rice (bottom of the image).  

figure(4)
th = 110;
while (th>0)
    th = input('threshold? (0=>end)');
    B = I>th;                % Binary image: '1' for gray-values>th
    figure(5)
    imshow(B)
    s = sprintf('Segmentation for th = %d',th);
    title(s);

%% 5. Background elimination
% Since the background is not homogoneous (the top is brighter than the 
% bottom), in this part, we attemp to set the background to zero. Thus, each
% row will be updated by subtracting its minimal value. 

[N,M] = size(I);
J     = I;
figure
for i=1:N
    row_i  = I(i,:);         % vector that contains the i-th row of I
    mi     = min(row_i);     % minimal value of i-th row 
    J(i,:) = row_i-mi;       % each row is decreased by its minimum
    imshow(J,[])
    pause(0.05)
end

%% 6. Segmentation of the new image
% In this part, we segment the new image (with zero background) using a 
% global threshold. First, we display the histogram where background and
% forground are clearly distinguishable. Second, we display the new binary
% image using a threshold = 40.

%% 7. Elimination of small regions (isolated pixeles)
% We observe that the new segmentation image has isolated pixels. 
% They correspond to noise in the background. In this part, we eliminate 
% those pixles using command 'bwareaopen'.

T = bwareaopen(K,20);        % regions which size is less than 20 pixels are eliminated
figure
imshow(T)

enterpause                   % Press <Enter> to continue...

%% 8. Labeling of regions
% In order to perform a pattern recognition approach (with feature 
% extraction and classification), we label each isolated region using the 
% command 'bwlabel'.

L = bwlabel(T);              % We assign a label to each region
n = max(L(:));               % Number of regions

title('Labeled regions')

enterpause                   % Press <Enter> to continue...

%% 9. Feature extraction
% In this part, for each labeled region we compute the size (area in
% pixels) and the center of mass (x,y in pixels). The area will be used in 
% the classification. The location (x,y) will not be used in the
% classification, it will be used only for printing the label number of
% each rice.

A = zeros(n,1);              % Area
x = zeros(n,1);              % Location x
y = zeros(n,1);              % Location y

for i=1:n
    R = L==i;               % Binary image '1' means pixel belongs to region i
    [ii,jj] = find(R==1);   % Coordinates of each pixel of region i
    A(i) = length(ii);      % Area of region i
    x(i) = mean(jj);        % x value of center of mass of region i
    y(i) = mean(ii);        % y value of center of mass of region j
    text(x(i),y(i),num2str(i))
end


%% 10. Classification of regions
% In this part, we attempt to classify each region in one of three classes: 
% XS (extra-small), OK and XL (extra-large). XS regions correspond to 
% regions that are incomplete (e.g. region 95). XL regions correspond to 
% regions that are joined (e.g. region 55). 

IXS = zeros(N,M);            % Image with XS rice
IXL = zeros(N,M);            % Image with XL rice
IOK = zeros(N,M);            % Image with OK rice
t   = 0;                     % count of segmented regions
AOK = zeros(n,1);            % area of segmented regions
for i=1:n
    R = L==i;                % We look for region i
    a = A(i);                % Area of region i
    if (a<100)               % XS regions
        IXS = or(IXS,R);     % Adding XS regions
    else
        if (a>300) % XL regions
            IXL = or(IXL,R); % Adding XL regions
        else
            IOK = or(IOK,R); % Adding OK regions
            t = t + 1;
            AOK(t) = a;
        end
    end
